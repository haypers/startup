# The Public Pixel

[My Notes](notes.md)

The public pixel is a community made pixel art engeine. Inspired by r/place, this will be a home for strangers to colaborate on pixle art.

Every five minutes a user may color a pixle. Between these moments, a user can 'plan' for a pixle, denoting that they plan for it to match a certain color in the future. When placing a pixle, users will be informed of any plans for that pixle and will have the opporutnity to accept or reject the plan.

Users get a log of users who accept their plan or override a pixle they built.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to make fun pixel art, but don't know where to start? don't worry! The public Pixel is where you can have fun making pixel art with the public, while engaging in a gamified turf war. Color pixles with the colors of the day, provided by a third party, and plan for future works to seek the colaboration of the internet.
