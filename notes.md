## AWS Notes

I setup my account, and bookmarked the dash.

## HTML Notes

There is a table element in html I could use for the pixles, but then I would need to css style a 50x50 grid of boxes, so maybe I just write a script to create the boxes.

For the html project, I don't know how to represent the popup that lets you see other player's plans, so I'll need to create that html live, using javascript, I think.

But I've got the main navigation working.

I think my first step will be to get css organising the screen correctly, and rendering a grid on mobile. That might be difficult.
